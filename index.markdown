ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Harry Graham.

I'm a Software Engineer, passionate about adding value, learning, and helping others. âœ¨

The projects I most enjoy working on have robust testing, fast iterations, low integration friction, and many other things that help me to feel empowered to both work efficiently and to add value.
