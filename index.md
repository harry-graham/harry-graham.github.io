ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Harry Graham.

I'm a full-stack Software Engineer, passionate about adding value, learning, and teaching others. âœ¨

My main experience so far is with Ruby on Rails, though I'm open to learning any technologies.

In my free time, I try to relax, look after my plants, and occasionally do some cooking.
